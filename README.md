Dear Waleed,

The Israeli Mosad, due to it's special recruitment methods, has access to all developers in the world.
Their cyber units are in constant growth, and need to provide support to various types of operations and technologies.
The challenge is to filter out and find the best matching candidates for the right position.

Your task will be to craft a React Native app, that will allow the Mosad recruiters to handle the vast amount of data on both ends.

### The Mosad recruiter is expecting to be able to:
1. Insert the parameters of his search, and have them stored in the app until he changes them, even if he closes the app
2. On each candidate should be able to swipe left or right (tinder style), which will mark the candidate as accepted or rejected
3. Mosad doesn't give second chances. Regardless of accepting or rejecting a candidate, he should never be shown again
4. Later on an interface to view accepted candidates will be developed, but this is out of scope for this task

### API
Get technologies:  
https://welcome.dropboy.io/technologies  
Get candidates:  
https://welcome.dropboy.io/candidates

### A few things to notice
1. A search parameter is a combination of a technology + years of experience
2. Unfortunately all Mosad backend engineers are on a vacation, filtering must be done in the app
3. The data set of candidates is vast and quickly growing, the app should not slow down with growth of the list to 100k records
4. User friendly UI is a plus
5. No need to display all data from endpoints, you choose only what you like - keep it simple
6. Unit test are a plus. e2e tests are a bigger plus
7. Please don't spend more than 4 hours on this task, it's alright if you don't complete it

Please submit your solution into this repository.
Don't hesitate to contact me on any question you might have :)

Good luck!
